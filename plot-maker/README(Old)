PlotMaker
=========

This program takes traceFile generated by kVMTrace and two Specs files, one for RAM and one for SSD.
The spec files are expected to have a list of Capacities (in MB), prices (in USD) and latency (in ns) for Ram
or SSDs respectively. The program takes each entry, extrapolating on more possible entries by taking the given
capacity and price for each latency and along with generating file for that particular capacity/price pair, also
generates file for all other n capacity/price tuples where n=((Maximum trace length)-(given capacity)/50).




The program generates two files for scattered plots for each capacity/price/latency:

-One file consists of price/delay tuples, where delay=(HDD time * #of Misses on SSD)+(SDD time * # of Misses on Ram); 
   To make the calculation more exact, we plan on adding (St*MRs) later
-Second file consists of price/capacity tuples.

To plot the files, use Gnuplot command -> plot 'filename'




The program also generates those two files for unscattered plots. These files are generatted with a constant 
RamSize for each possible SSD combination and to plot them, one needs to use the following Gnuplot command ->
plot 'filename' with lines.


Each of the program methods have comments which I hope make everything clear, however, in case of questions, contact
me at mmargishvili15@amherst.edu


Here are the contents of the two spec files I fed to the program:


RAMFile: 
256 2.186875 51


SSD File:
256 0.25 11111

We clearly need more data to generate better plots.


The traceFiles and miss-to-hit files are in my cluster at /kVMTrace-merger/
