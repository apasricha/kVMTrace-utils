Operates on text file representations of hit histograms, summing "from the right"
to create a miss histogram.  Both input and output are "memory-size value" pairs
on a per-line, space-delimeted basis.  Each number is a text decimal notation.
All input and output are on stdin/stdout.

To compile:

  $ gcc -O4 -o htom htom.c

To run:

  $ ./htom 123456 < foo.hits > foo.misses

Note that the command line argument is the footprint, in decimal.
