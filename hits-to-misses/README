Extracts a hit histograms from our LRU database (based on the name of
a workload), then summing "from the right" to create a miss histogram.
The output is a sequence of "memory-size value" pairs on a per-line,
space-delimeted basis.  Each number is a text decimal notation.  All
output is to a file whose name is taken from the workload name and the
suffixed with '.misses'.

To run:

  $ ./hits-to-misses.sh eclipse
  $ less eclipse.misses
  [...]
